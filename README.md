# Directory-tree-to-csv
Python script that saves directory tree structure into a csv table. 
tree command in linux required.

directories.py - creates a csv file from a chosen directory.

dirs_normal.py - transforms the table obtained from directories.py into a classical directory structure.

The subdirectory dirs/ contains a Windows executable that saves directory tree structure into a csv table.
Please, unzip the lib.zip file (it contains folder lib). Download with all the files in folder dirs/.
The executable is ready to run.
Edit the file path.txt so it contains the path to your directory. The number in the second line is the
maximum depth you want the program to scan (when set to 0, no limit on depth).
